      <Header>Introduction to Prime Spirals</Header>
      <Body>
        Primes are still one of the great mysteries of mathematics. The quality
        of being prime seems to be intrinsic to numbers, yet the pattern of
        prime numbers remains elusive. There is no equation that can determine
        if a number is prime; the only way to know if a number is prime is
        through brute-force testing. There is also no way to generate prime
        numbers. You can only guess a number and check if you are right.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        For all the mysteries surrounding prime numbers, there are a few things
        we do know. The problem is that most things we know are statistical in
        nature. For example, we know that prime numbers become exponentially
        less likely the further up the number line we travel.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        We also know that prime numbers tend to congregate along certain
        functions. 2‚Åø - 1 is a prime example (pun intended), where <I>n</I> is a
        positive integer. Primes that can be generated using this equation are
        known as Mersenne Primes.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        There are other equations out there that generate primes more
        consistently than other equations. These equations can be difficult to
        find, but one strategy for finding them is to build helpful
        visualizations for primes.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        One of the most popular visualizations for primes is called the{' '}
        <b>Ulam spiral</b>. To construct this spiral, numbers are placed into a
        square grid starting at 1 and spiraling outward.

      />
      <Body>
        Then, the prime numbers are highlighted or marked in some way.

        If you carry this out far enough, you will start to see diagonal lines
        magically appear. It is amazing that the randomness of primes can
        produce discernable patterns like this.

      <Header>The Question</Header>
      <Body>
        One of my favorite methods of mathematical exploration can be described
        in a simple formula:
      </Body>
      <Indent>1) Find a popular mathematical concept.</Indent>
      <Indent>
        2) Think about which aspects of that concept are arbitrary.
      </Indent>
      <Indent>3) Change those things and see what happens!</Indent>
      <Body>
        We already did number 1 by finding this idea of a prime spiral. So let's
        look at number 2.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        I like the focus on primes, so I'm not going to mess with that. But the
        construction of this spiral seems like something that could easily
        change. This spiral was constructed very predictably. The lines always
        turn left once there is room to do so, and in this way, the spiral fills
        up all the available space.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        What if we allowed the prime numbers to determine the shape of the
        spiral instead?
      </Body>
      <Body>
        Say we start with 2 and draw a line of length 2. Then after that, we
        make a left turn and draw a line of length 3. Another left turn, and we
        draw a line of length 5. We can carry that out for as long as we want.
      </Body>
      <Image src={SpiralPrimeLength} width={500} />
      <Body>
        Well... it wasn't all I was hoping for. There aren't any clear patterns
        emerging, at least not to my eye. Maybe it would be better if the lines
        didn't get huge so quickly.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        I've got it! I can take the <i>gaps</i> in between the primes to
        determine the length of the lines.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        So the first two primes are 2 and 3. That's a gap of 1. The next prime
        is 5, which is 2 away from 3. The next prime is 7, which is 2 away from
        5.{' '}
      </Body>
      <Image src={NumberLineGaps} width={600} />
      <Body>
        If we carry this out and count the gaps, we can keep generating the
        length of the next line.
      </Body>
      <Body>Let me see how that looks up to 100.</Body>
      <Image src={Spiral100} />
      <Body>
        For starters, it's not clear where the spiral is going because the lines
        are overlapping. It's a little anti-climactic, but there is also a sort
        of pattern-like quality in the randomness. Let me try cranking it up to
        10,000.
      </Body>
      <Image src={Spiral10000} />
      <Body>
        Woah! That is the kind of stuff I live for! The combination of
        pattern-like and random is beautiful. It's like the primes all worked
        together to paint a picture.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        Okay, I have to test my limits, right? Let's try all the primes up to
        10,000,000
      </Body>
      <Image src={Spiral10000000} />
      <Body>
        Either I'm going crazy, or the prime numbers just made a seahorse.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        At this point, the program is running so slowly that I'm unsure how high
        I can continue. Rendering so many lines on screens takes a lot of CPU.
        So the question is, how can I access those larger numbers?
      </Body>
      <Body>
        One possible solution is to change the starting number. I've been
        starting at 2, but that was an arbitrary decision. Why not try starting
        somewhere else? Let's see what happens if I make a spiral using the
        primes between 10,000,000 and 20,000,000.
      </Body>
      <Image src={Spiral1000000020000000} />
      <Body>
        Darn, I was hoping for another animal. I'll call this one a turtle with
        a long tail ending in the number 3.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        Just by these rules, I could have a ton of fun constructing spirals if I
        just change the range of numbers I'm looking at.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        But it strikes me that I made one more arbitrary decisions. At the end
        of each line, I choose to turn left 90 degrees. What happens if I change
        that angle?
      </Body>
      <Body>
        For example, what if I do the primes up to 10,000 again, but this time I
        turn 60 degrees between each line instead of 90?
      </Body>
      <Image src={Spiral1000060deg} />
      <Body>
        Hey, that's got the same sort of beauty that a 90 degree turn makes! I
        have to think a 120 degree turn will be cool as well.
      </Body>
      <Image src={Spiral10000120deg} />
      <Body>
        That is so unexpectedly dense! Even with the randomness of prime
        numbers, all these lines ended up in roughly the same region. Huh.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        Now I just want to go crazy. How does a 1 degree turn and a 179 degree
        turn look?
      </Body>
      <Image src={Spiral100001deg} />
      <Image src={Spiral10000179deg} />
      <Body>
        Is it weird if I laugh? What cool results! All of this generated from
        the seeming randomness of primes. These are the kinds of pieces that we
        need in art museums, people!
      </Body>
      <Body>
        For now, I am content with these parameters, but you better believe I'm
        going to go on generating all sorts of other spirals. And you can join
        me! Head over to the{' '}
